üìö Topics Covered
This cheatsheet includes a wide range of operations, from basic to advanced:

Grouping & Counting: $group, $sum, $avg

Filtering: $match

Shaping Documents: $project, $set, $addFields

Array & String Manipulation: $unwind, $concat, $toUpper

Conditional Logic: $cond, $switch

Joins: $lookup

...and much more!

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use
You can browse the mongo.json file to find examples relevant to your needs. Copy the command from the "query" field and paste it directly into your MongoDB Shell (mongosh) or adapt it for your specific application driver.
